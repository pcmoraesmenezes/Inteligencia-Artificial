# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow

## Chapter 1 - Machine Learning Landscape

Machine Learning is the process of a machine learning from data. This process don't happen by itself, so if I download a page in web my machine will have the data, but not the knowledge. The machine will need to learn from the data to extract knowledge from it. The process of learning from data is called training.

The process of a machine learning training can be describe as:

1. Get the data

2. Train a model

3. Evaluate the model

   **If** the model is not good, **then** we need to tune the model or get more data.
   
   **Else** continue with the current model.


The great advantage of an machine learning process is that humans can learn from the machine learning process. The humans can inspect the solution and understand how the machine is solving the problem. This is called **data mining**.
